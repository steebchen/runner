Run Claude Code, Codex and OpenCode in parallel, each in its own git worktree, then review the diffs and ship PRs from one fast desktop app.

Suneiro uses the agent CLIs you already have and the subscriptions you're already signed in to (Claude Pro/Max, ChatGPT). It never proxies or stores credentials.

## Features

- **Workspaces**: every task gets its own git worktree and branch, created from the latest upstream base branch. The branch is renamed after the task (`suneiro/fix-login-bug`) until it's pushed. Start from scratch, from an existing branch, or from a pull request (⇧⌘N).
- **Agents over ACP**: Claude Code, Codex and OpenCode all speak the [Agent Client Protocol](https://agentclientprotocol.com), so the chat UI, tool calls, plans, questions, slash commands and model pickers work the same for every agent.
- **Chat**: attach screenshots (paste, pick or drop), `@`-mention files, `/` commands, queue or steer follow-ups, recall earlier prompts with ↑, find in chat (⌘F), and restore the workspace's files to how they were before any message (checkpoints, with undo).
- **Review**: changed files and syntax-highlighted diffs against the merge base, "viewed" marks, line comments sent back to the agent, and per-file discard. The sidebar shows each workspace's `+/−` lines.
- **Stay in sync**: see when the base branch moved on and merge it in with one click; conflicts can be handed to the agent.
- **Ship**: create a PR (with an AI-written title and description if you like), push with generated commit messages, view CI checks, "fix failing checks", merge, and archive merged workspaces.
- **Terminals**: per-workspace shells and a one-click `run` script, with clickable links and an "open" button for the dev server it starts. Each workspace gets its own `SUNEIRO_PORT` range.
- **Settings**: detects installed agents and their login status, installs or signs in through an embedded terminal; per-repository setup/run/archive scripts and files to copy; default models, branch prefix, workspaces folder, editor and theme. ⌘/ lists all shortcuts.

## Requirements

- macOS (Linux and Windows are planned; the core is platform-neutral)
- Rust 1.85+, Node 20+, pnpm
- `git`, and optionally `gh` (for PRs)
- At least one agent: `claude`, `codex` or `opencode`. The Claude and Codex ACP adapters run via `npx`.

## Development

```sh
pnpm install
pnpm dev           # Tauri app with hot reload
pnpm test          # Rust tests (core, including a scripted ACP agent)
pnpm typecheck
pnpm build         # Suneiro.app + .dmg in target/release/bundle
```

UI-only work: run `pnpm --filter desktop dev` and open http://localhost:1420. In a plain browser, a fake backend (`src/dev/mock.ts`) streams scripted agent output. It is only loaded in dev mode.

Real end-to-end smoke test against your installed agents:

```sh
cargo run -p suneiro-core --example detect                 # what Suneiro sees
cargo run -p suneiro-core --example e2e -- /path/to/repo claude
```

## Repository config: `suneiro.json`

Optional, committed at the repo root:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "setup": "pnpm install",
    "run": "pnpm dev",
    "archive": "docker compose down"
  },
  "copy": [".env", ".env.local"]
}
```

`setup` runs in each new worktree (output appears in the Setup tab). `copy` brings gitignored files over from the main checkout. Scripts and workspace terminals get `SUNEIRO_ROOT_PATH`, `SUNEIRO_WORKSPACE_NAME`, `SUNEIRO_WORKSPACE_PATH` and `SUNEIRO_PORT` (the first of 10 ports reserved for the workspace, so dev servers of parallel workspaces don't collide).

Configuration is read from `suneiro.json`, then legacy `runner.json`, then `conductor.json` (first readable, valid file wins). `RUNNER_*` and `CONDUCTOR_*` remain aliases for the `SUNEIRO_*` script variables. The same settings can also be made per repository in Settings → Repositories; a committed file takes precedence per script.

## Upgrading from Runner

Suneiro reuses an existing Runner database and attachments in place, keeping saved repositories, sessions, settings and workspace paths. New installations use `com.suneiro.desktop` / `suneiro.sqlite`, with workspaces under `~/suneiro/workspaces` and a `suneiro/` branch prefix. Existing custom settings are preserved. Checkpoint refs and archive keys retain their internal legacy namespace for compatibility.

## Brand assets

The source mark is `apps/desktop/public/suneiro-mark.svg`. Run `pnpm icons` after editing it to regenerate the app icon and all desktop bundle formats. Light mode uses white and neutral gray surfaces with ink-blue accents, alongside a matching dark theme; see [DESIGN.md](apps/desktop/DESIGN.md).

## Architecture

```
apps/desktop/src          React 19 UI (zustand, TanStack Virtual, xterm.js)
apps/desktop/src-tauri    Thin Tauri 2 bindings: commands + event channel
crates/core               Everything else, UI-agnostic:
  acp.rs                  JSON-RPC/ACP client over agent stdio
  agent.rs                Sessions: spawn, resume, prompt, permissions, config
  git.rs / forge.rs       git worktrees & diffs / GitHub via `gh`
  pty.rs                  Terminals (portable-pty)
  store.rs                SQLite (WAL), batched append-only transcript log
  setup.rs                Agent detection + settings
```

Performance notes:

- Core events are buffered and flushed to the UI once per frame over a single Tauri channel.
- Each session's transcript is folded incrementally, and only changed rows re-render.
- The transcript and diff are virtualized.
- Terminals live outside React, so switching workspaces never recreates them.
- Streamed chunks are merged before they're written to SQLite.
